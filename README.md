This is a CPU Scheduling simulator that supports dynmically adding and removing processes/tasks by providing their name, arrival time, burst time, and priority.
The program provides a simulation of which process started and how long it was being processed and if another process interrupted it or it terminated.
It also provides the waiting time per process and the average waiting time for all algorithms.
Supported algorthims are:
1- Preeptimve Priority
2- Non-Preemptive Priority
3- Preemptive Shortest Job First
4- Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First
5- First Come First Served
6- Round Robin with custom quantum time
This was an OS task in my university that should've been a team-project but I choose to implement everything myself.
